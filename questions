Difference between switch and checkout:

In Git 2.23 and later, git switch and git restore are considered more user-friendly alternatives to git checkout.
git switch is used for switching branches, while git restore is used for restoring working tree files.
git checkout is a more general-purpose command that can be used for switching branches, creating branches, and more. However, it is being phased out in favor of the more specialized commands.

What does git merge do:

git merge is used to combine changes from different branches. It merges the changes into the current branch, creating a new commit that has both sets of changes.
If changes are made to the same part of a file in both branches, Git may create a merge conflict, and manual intervention is needed to resolve the conflict.

What happens to the commit history after rebase and why:

During a rebase, the commit history is rewritten. Instead of merging the changes of one branch into another, it integrates the changes of one branch onto another, resulting in a linear history.
Commits from the rebased branch are applied one by one on top of the target branch, effectively changing the commit history.
This can create a cleaner and more linear history but should be used with caution, especially if the branch has been shared with others.
